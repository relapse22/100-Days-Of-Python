# Playing Around with what i learned on day 1 
# When doing day 1 I thought back on when I was learning alittle about f strings & And playing with lists
# Played around with it abit here in my creativity. 

# Storing characters into a list[] & Some words into a string.
Southpark_Characters = "Stan", "Cartmen", "Kenny", "Kyle" 
some_words = "How can you think that!\nI don't understand how you can say that\nSee these guys right here\n"

# Getting the user input.
greeting_input = input("Hello there! What's You Favorite T.V show? ")

# Printing with a f string.
# print(f"{greeting_input}!!\n{some_words} {Southpark_Characters}")

# Changing the variable Southpark_Characters.
Southpark_Characters = "SOUTHPARK!"

# Printing out the changed variable.
print(input("Okey ill give you one more chance. What your favorite T.V show? "))
print(f"You got to be kidding me this is the best show is!\n{Southpark_Characters}")
 
# How it was done in the video adding variables
# print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")
# street = input("What's name of the city you grew up in?\n")
# pet = input("What's your pet's name?\n")
# print("Your band name could be " + street + " " + pet)
